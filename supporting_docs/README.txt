Assignment 1: Web Development
Submission date: 15/01/2017

I used the initial template we designed in class that was available on Liz Coulter-Smith's Codepen. My personal goal was to create a simplistic website with minimal CSS rules, and to create as much as possible by hand, without using code from elsewhere. I did not collaborate with no one, however the few places I have taken code from has been referenced in the code. Every page uses one column apart from the CV page, which uses flex box to arrange the columns into two rows when the width is smaller than 30em. I have used em for all measurements instead of pixels. This is because of the wide range of devices available. I have also used main, aside, footer and header instead of standard divs. This allows for better reading for impaired users. The headings at the top stack vertically when the page is smaller than 30em. I would have liked to include more media queries for other device types such as tablets. 

Things that I would have liked to improve on include the following.

1) The general aesthetics of the pages. I would have liked a more sleeker, modern look. Currently the web pages look very static and 'boring', resembling a word document rather than a web page. The presentation of information is in a basic textual format, which may cause some readers to skim through the page rather than 

2) Sectioning. I feel as if the information was laid out in sections rather than one big block of information (in relevance to the CV page), then it would be more pleasing to the eye, and there would not be an information overload.

3) Colour schemes. I have tried to stick to the colour schemes that are available via google material design. However, I feel like these are too bright, and do not convey a professional image when viewed by someone.

4) Use of graphics and images. Currently, there are no graphics or images on the page. Therefore, there is no signposting. As well as this, an overload of text can be boring. I would like to increase the amount of graphical information so there is less reading for the user. However, the increase of graphics makes it harder for a visually impaired person to use the website. There is no background image and this is to convey a professional look.

I spent roughly 12-16 hours on this assignment.
